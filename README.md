Coding by Example

Learn to code by example

Motivation
----------

As much as I love sites like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), the format of voting answers up and down feels awkward. While I appreciate that it motivates people to answer well, far too often I have to hunt through all of the answers to get a complete answer.

A wiki seems like it'd be a better fit.

Accordingly, this repo houses a wiki that does exactly that.

To Use
------

Go to the GitHub wiki, and follow the instructions there.

Future Directions
-----------------

Eventually, this will be turned into a real website.
